# Monopoly Hardware Audio Legal Shortlist (Strict Pass)

Date: 2026-02-28  
Branch: `monopoly`

## Scope

Target event IDs:

- `play_theme`
- `star_wars_theme`
- `junior_coin_sound_powerup`

This pass focuses on "closest-to-board feel" while keeping redistributable licensing clear.

## Legal Status Key

- `ship_now_attribution`: Can be committed and redistributed now with attribution kept in-repo.
- `ship_now_sharealike_review`: Usable, but verify project-level compatibility if we distribute derivatives/remixes.
- `reference_only`: Useful for matching tone, but do not ship as bundled assets without explicit rights.

## Ranked Candidates

## Recommendation

Recommended legal swap set (closest fit + lowest license friction):

1. Keep `junior_coin_sound_powerup` as current `Collect_Point_00` mapping.
2. Use `star_wars_theme` from Sci-Fi pack `Jingle_Win_01`.
3. Use `play_theme` from Electric pack `SpaceEngine_Start_01`.

Status on this branch: applied.  
All three live mappings now resolve to CC-BY 3.0 stand-ins from the same author/publisher family (Little Robot Sound Factory), which simplifies attribution and keeps a coherent synthesis style.
